# Tsukikage
Tsukikage is a program that reads the JSON output produced by [OwOCR](https://github.com/AuroraWright/owocr), which contains OCRed text and their coordinates, and sends the preferred output when the user hovers over the corresponding regions. See [Tsukikage.ini](https://github.com/rampaa/Tsukikage/blob/master/Tsukikage/Tsukikage.ini) for all available settings and output types.
